    <h2 class="haiku">The Beer</h2>
    <p>
    The brewers claim to have souped up the malting a bit since it was in stubbies;
    it certainly pours a little darker and hangs around the palate a little longer.
    It's a session beer with plenty of tropical fruit notes and a good hop balance.
    Not as plain as the packaging but a non-nonsense, well-crafted pale.

    <h2 class="haiku">The Brewery</h2>
    <p>
    Founded back in 2014, and launched in February 2015, the company has its roots much earlier. Mazen Hajjar, our founder, started the Middle East's first craft brewery back during the July 2006 war between Israel and Hizbollah. By the time he left, his old company was exporting beer to 26 different countries including Australia.
    </p><p>
After one of his trips to Australia and while hawking beers in a Sydney suburb, the decision to start a brewery in Australia was made.
    </p><p>
The name Hawkers is inspired from the street vendors, that roamed Australia from the early days of the colony. Many early immigrants were hawkers as they needed little capital and skill to push a cart and earn a living. Their activities were critical for the health of many regional economies and they helped spread the colony further.
    </p><p>
Hawkers is a fiercely independent company, and with our unconditional commitment to spreading flavourful beer, we keep striving to achieve our goal of converting 100% of the market to drinking better beers.

<h2 class="haiku">Beer Fact of the Day</h2>
<p>
When scientist Niels Bohr won the Nobel Prize in 1922, the Carlsberg brewery gave
him a house next door to the brewery. The house had a direct pipeline to the 
brewery to provide him with free beer on tap whenever he wanted.
