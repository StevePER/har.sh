    <h2 class="haiku">The Beer</h2>
    <p>
This might be Moo's most famous beer. Colloquially known as the velvet sledgehammer, it's black, it's silky, it smacks you in the mouth. Beer nerds talk up the intense composition of roasted malts and hop-driven bitterness. Then they start singing and dancing. It's that kind of beer.

    <h2 class="haiku">The Brewery</h2>
    <p>
    Moo Brew was founded in 2005, 15 minutes from Hobart, by David Walsh, creator of Mona (the Museum of Old and New Art). Everything about Moo Brew is a bit unconventional. The cellar door is at a museum, and the idea for the beer started with a bottle. David Walsh built the brewery at his Moorilla Estate winery, and this formed the basis of his brewery's name - Moo Brew.
    </p><p>
    By 2010, the Tasmanian brewery had outgrown its fledgling site and moved to a bigger site 10 minutes up the road at Bridgewater. Moo Brew is now Tasmania's largest craft brewery. The unique artwork on the bottles and cans is the work of renowned and controversial Australian artist John Kelly.

<h2 class="haiku">Beer Fact of the Day</h2>
<p>
Some of humanity's earliest known writings refer to the production and distribution of beer.
The Code of Hammurabi included laws regulating beer and beer parlours, and &#x201c;The Hymn to Ninkasi&#x201d;,
a prayer to the Mesopotamian goddess of beer, served as both a prayer and as a method of
remembering the recipe for beer in a culture with few literate people.
