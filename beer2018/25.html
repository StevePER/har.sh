    <h2 class="haiku">The Beer</h2>
    <p>
    Twelve Days is a dark brown strong beer brewed for Christmas. A finely balanced ale, lightly hopped with a strong malt and nutty flavor. The strength gives the beer a smooth lingering aftertaste. A definite ale to savour.

    <h2 class="haiku">The Brewery</h2>
    <p>
    Hook Norton Brewery began life in 1849 when a chap called John Harris purchased a 52-acre farm that included a malthouse. He took over the existing trade as a maltster and expanded the business by becoming a dealer in hops. A commercial brewery was the logical next step. The original brewing books begin with brew No.1 on November 24th, 1856, when they brewed a &#x201c;Mild XXX&#x201d;.
    </p><p>
    Around 1890 the Victorian tower brewery was built. All the stages of the brewing process flow logically from floor to floor; mashing at the top, boiling in the middle, fermentation and racking at the bottom.  Nowadays Hook Norton is the finest example of a Victorian Tower Brewery in the country. It's an incredible building, if a little terrifying.
    </p><p>
    Hook Norton is one of only 32 family owned breweries remaining in the UK. James Clarke, the great great grandson of John Harris joined the family business in 1991 and became Head Brewer in 1998. Upon the death of his father in 2004, James followed in his family's tradition and became Managing Director, a position that he still holds.

<h2 class="haiku">Beer Fact of the Day</h2>
<p>
The word ale comes from Old English ealu (plural ealo&thorn;), in turn from Proto-Germanic alu (plural alu&thorn;), and ultimately from a Proto-Indo-European base which holds connotations of &#x201c;sorcery, magic, possession, intoxication&#x201d;.
