    <h2 class="haiku">The Beer</h2>
    <p>
    Rich, roast malts manage to hold their own against what can only be described as a barrage of new world hop character. The citrus fruit aroma dominates the nose and provides an amazing contrast to the roasted tones of the malt. On the palate there is a delicious orangey, chocolate combination which is accentuated perfectly by a lingering malty sweetness.

    <h2 class="haiku">The Brewery</h2>
    <p>
    Inspiration struck unexpectedly when Jack Cameron woke at six o'clock in the morning with lyrics from a Disney sea shanty sailing through his head.
    </p><p>
    Naming a brewery is no small matter, and after endless attempts to do so that were, in Cameron's words, &#x201c;all garbage,&#x201d; he and his partners &mdash; his father, Michael, and his friend Jared &#x201c;Red&#x201d; Proudfoot &mdash; had decided to take a break. They knew the right name would come eventually, but that it might help if they stopped trying to think so goddamned hard about it.
    </p><p>
    In less than three years the brewery has become one of Australia's greatest success stories, expanding their export business while distributing to all corners of the home continent from their strategically located facility in Adelaide's Hindmarsh suburb. Last year Pirate Life was the only brewery with more than one top-10 entry in the GABS Hottest 100 Aussie Craft Beers competition (they had three).
