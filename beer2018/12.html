    <h2 class="haiku">The Beer</h2>
    <p>
    Our Saison is inspired from the beers we grew to love in Belgium, in particular Dupont's amazing version.  We use White Labs Belgian II Saison yeast (WLP566) which drives the character of the beer.  Hints of peppery citrus, straw and a sweet honey funk on the nose. Flavours of semi-dry citrus pith, earthy breads, subtle caramels, crisp honey and a dry spicy funkiness to finish.

    <h2 class="haiku">The Brewery</h2>
    <p>
    Frase and Grum first met in 2000 working in IT in Melbourne.  We went our separate ways but wound up living in the UK and Europe for about 10 years, where we fell in love with many interesting beer styles (helped by a large number of trips to Belgium) and started home brewing.  Bored with our day jobs, we decided when we moved back to Melbourne, that we would attempt to start a brewery. 
    </p><p>
Having decided beer was the future, the next step was to come up with a brewery name.  One day, Grum after much contemplation, emerged from the smallest room in the house declaring that he had a name, announcing &#x201c;Exit&#x201d;.  Frase was at this stage, slightly underwhelmed until Grum explained that as they were in IT and beer was a means of getting out of said IT shenanigans, that we would in fact be &#x201c;ex-IT&#x201d; people.  So thus a brewery name was born.  We then got an opportunity to purchase a fermenter in the Cavalier Brewery and released our first beer, a Saison in April 2014.  Not having a large capacity and being unknown at the time we decided not to go with a core range of beers with the one tank and instead brewed individual numbered batches.

vat was ruptured. The flood killed eight people.
