<h1 class="haiku">Frankenstein</h1>
<h2 class="haiku">by Mary Shelley</h2>
<div class="haikus">
<div><h3>1</h3><p>
Her blue eyes cloudless
<br>
Unbending disposition
<br>
Benevolent mind
</p></div>
<div><h3>2</h3><p>
So full of kindness
<br>
Ready to envelop me
<br>
Into poverty
</p></div>
<div><h3>3</h3><p>
Old familiar faces
<br>
A repulsive countenance
<br>
Now the scene was changed
</p></div>
<div><h3>4</h3><p>
Like a hurricane
<br>
Infallible misery
<br>
To your destruction
</p></div>
<div><h3>5</h3><p>
Disgust filled my heart
<br>
Seemingly to detain me
<br>
On a lonely road
</p></div>
<div><h3>6</h3><p>
Kind faces around me
<br>
Through a strange perversity
<br>
Extremely pretty
</p></div>
<div><h3>7</h3><p>
The filthy demon
<br>
Whose delight was in carnage
<br>
Her words pierce my heart
</p></div>
<div><h3>8</h3><p>
Always engaging
<br>
She collected her powers
<br>
To shed countless tears
</p></div>
<div><h3>9</h3><p>
Shining pyramids
<br>
Could redeem my soul from woe
<br>
Sleep crept over me
</p></div>
<div><h3>10</h3><p>
My soul glowed with love
<br>
While rain poured from the dark sky
<br>
Do not disdain me
</p></div>
<div><h3>11</h3><p>
A young man met her
<br>
He then pronounced a few sounds
<br>
They sat down to eat
</p></div>
<div><h3>12</h3><p>
In contemplation
<br>
Her eyes sometimes filled with tears
<br>
It was poverty
</p></div>
<div><h3>13</h3><p>
In a sweet accent
<br>
A thousand sights of beauty
<br>
From which all men ran
</p></div>
<div><h3>14</h3><p>
A sum of money
<br>
Refinement of intellect
<br>
He gloried in it
</p></div>
<div><h3>15</h3><p>
They were contented
<br>
Cannot you undeceive them?
<br>
A silence ensued
</p></div>
<div><h3>16</h3><p>
Snow poured around me
<br>
My feelings were those of rage
<br>
Cursed creator!
</p></div>
<div><h3>17</h3><p>
Leave me in darkness
<br>
As hideous as myself
<br>
It shall content me
</p></div>
<div><h3>18</h3><p>
Inaccessible
<br>
A meandering river
<br>
Surrounded by black woods
</p></div>
<div><h3>19</h3><p>
The majestic oaks
<br>
Followed him as his shadow
<br>
Ascertain my fate
</p></div>
<div><h3>20</h3><p>
My nerves were agitated
<br>
He had loitered in the forest
<br>
With an oaten cake
</p></div>
<div><h3>21</h3><p>
My eyes half open
<br>
On the every edge of death
<br>
The fiend was not here
</p></div>
<div><h3>22</h3><p>
During my illness
<br>
Death was inevitable
<br>
The seal to my fate
</p></div>
<div><h3>23</h3><p>
Her head hanging down
<br>
Unmingled with disbelief
<br>
The deadly languor
</p></div>
<div><h3>24</h3><p>
Like a mighty tide
<br>
My heart bounded within me
<br>
Full of treachery
</div></div>
