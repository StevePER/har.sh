<h1 class="haiku">Garage Door Monitor</h1>

<p>
I've left the garage door open at least a couple of times. My wife has done it at least once.
Surely something can be done to alert us if this happens again! For this project I used an 
<a class="ul" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ESP32">ESP32</a>
to monitor the state of the garage door, and a simple server-side Rust process to generate alerts
if the door is left open for too long.
</p>

<h2 class="haiku">Hardware</h2>

<p>
As the ESP32's built-in <a class="ul" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hall_effect_sensor">Hall Effect sensor</a>
can detect a magnetic field, the hardware for this project consisted of simply:<br/>
  &#x25ba; An ESP32-PICO-KIT (but any ESP32 would do)<br/>
  &#x25ba; A USB charger and cable<br/>
  &#x25ba; A magnet
</p>
<p>
By using the built-in sensor, there is no wiring required, apart from plugging in a USB charger
to provide power.
</p>

<h2 class="haiku">Reading from the Hall Effect sensor</h2>

<p>
Reading from the Hall Effect sensor is very easy. First the ADC1 module needs to be configured
to reading 12 bit values, as the Hall Effect sensor readings to not cover the full range of the
input. Then we can read from the sensor simply by calling <code>hall_sensor_read()</code>.
</p>
<p>
<code>adc1_config_width(ADC_WIDTH_BIT_12);<br/>
    ...<br/>
    int value = hall_sensor_read();</code>
</p>

<p>
At first glance the Hall Effect sensor on the ESP32 acts a lot like a random number generator &mdash;
the values it returns are super noisy! A simple way to filter out the noise is to perform lots of
readings (200) and average them.
</p>

<h2 class="haiku">Is the door open or closed?</h2>

<p>
This logic is implemented on the ESP32. It could easily be implemented on the server-side instead.
I read 200 samples from the Hall Effect sensor every 5 seconds, and then decide whether the door
is open or closed.
</p>

<p>
My initial idea to define fixed thresholds for door open and door closed didn't work reliably. The values
returned by the sensor seemed to drift over time, possibly due to temperature. Instead I maintain an
average of recent readings from when the door is considered closed, and define a difference threshold
relative to this average.

</p>

<h2 class="haiku">ESP32 to server messaging</h2>

<p>
To keep things simple, I use a fixed message format over UDP. The message is only sent when we determine
that the door is open, and for 30 seconds after the door closes. The message contains three fields:<br/>
&#x25ba; An indication of whether the door is open or closed<br/>
&#x25ba; Number of seconds since the last state change<br/>
&#x25ba; The most recent sensor reading (for debugging).
</p>

<p>
The IP addresses of the ESP32 and the server are hardcoded, as is the port number for the UDP messages.
UDP is a connectionless protocol, so this simplifies the the implementation on both sides.
</p>

<h2 class="haiku">Server-side processing</h2>
<p>
On the server side I use syslog to log when the door changes state, but otherwise the alerting behaviour
is config-driven. I use <a class="ul" href="https://www.callmebot.com">CallMeBot</a> and their
<a class="ul" href="https://www.callmebot.com/blog/free-api-signal-send-messages/">Signal API</a> to send
messages when the door has been left open for too long, and then again when the door is closed.
</p>
<p>
Configuration defines:<br/>
&#x25ba; How long the door needs to have been open before sending an alert,<br />
&#x25ba; The phone number of the recipient,<br />
&#x25ba; The recipient's CallMeBot API key,<br />
&#x25ba; The message text for when the door is open, and for when it is closed.<br />

</p>

<h2 class="haiku">Monitoring</h2>
<p>
<a class="ul" href="https://mmonit.com/monit">monit</a> is used to monitor the state of the ESP32 (via ping), and
that the server process is running and listening on the expected UDP port. I'll receive an email if either
side fails, and the server process can be restarted automatically.
</p>
<p>
Not long after the initial deployment this monitoring identified that if the ESP32 lost its wifi connection,
it never came back. As this is a rare occurrence, I fixed it in the simplest possible way by rebooting the
ESP32 on disconnection.
<p>

<h2 class="haiku">What went wrong</h2>
<p>
No matter how much I tweaked the algorithm, I couldn't get the sensor to reliably detect when the door
was open or closed. It nearly always worked, but when you get a message saying the garage door is open
when nobody is home, it's somewhat concerning.
</p>
<p>
This issue happened rarely enough that it was impossible to debug.
</p>

<h2 class="haiku">Ultrasonic distance sensor</h2>
<p>
I gave up on the Hall effect sensor, and purchased an HC-SR04 Ultrasonic Distance sensor. This sensor
has four connectors &mdash; VCC, ground, trigger and echo. Connect VCC to +5V on the ESP32, ground
to GND, trigger and echo to GPIO pins.
</p>
<p>
<img src="garage_monitor_wiring.png" alt="ESP32 to HC-SR04 ultrasonic distance sensor wiring diagram" />
</p>
<p>
<code>gpio_set_direction(TRIGGER_PIN, GPIO_MODE_OUTPUT);<br/>
      gpio_set_direction(ECHO_PIN, GPIO_MODE_INPUT);</br>
      ...<br/>
      // set trigger pin high for 10us<br />
      ESP_ERROR_CHECK(gpio_set_level(TRIGGER_PIN, 1));<br/>
      usleep(10);<br/>
      ESP_ERROR_CHECK(gpio_set_level(TRIGGER_PIN, 0));<br/>
      ...<br/>
      // wait for the echo pin to go high<br />
      while( !gpio_get_level( ECHO_PIN ) );<br/>
      int64_t start = esp_timer_get_time();<br/>
      // wait for the echo pin to go low<br />
      while( gpio_get_level( ECHO_PIN ) );<br/>
      int64_t stop = esp_timer_get_time();</code>
</p>
<p>
Just imagine that the code above contains a little more error checking to ensure we don't
get stuck in and endless loop. My 
<a class="ul" href="https://bitbucket.org/harshbutfair/garage/src/main/">code is on Bitbucket</a>
if you want to see how I did it. Then to determine the distance:
</p>
<p>
<code>int64_t time_diff = stop - start;  // microseconds<br />
    // speed of sound 343m/s, half the distance to account for the sound<br />
    // travelling there and back<br />
    double distance = time_diff * 0.0343 * 0.5;   // centimetres</code>
</p>
<p>
Then a simple threshold can be used to determine whether the door is open or closed. I set
the threshold to 1 metre and placed the sensor approximately 65cm from the garage door.
</p>
<p>
One advantage of an ultrasonic sensor is that they look like eyes, so for a bit of fun you
can add a face and give your project a name. This is Gary, the garage door monitor.
